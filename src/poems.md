The Funeral for Fairy Tales

Today we bury happily ever afterin a shallow grave beside the tracks.No eulogy, no flowers, no laughter—just the sound of illusions breaking their backs.

I came to mourn the Prince Charming lie,the myth that rescue rides a white horse,the fantasy that someone from the skydescends to save you as a matter of course.

Cinderella died of exposure last winter,still waiting for the glass slipper to fit.Snow White choked on the poisoned splinterof trusting strangers who smile and sit

too close, too friendly, too interested.Sleeping Beauty never woke—learned too late that being the fairestis just another way to get broke

by those who profit from your dreaming,who sell you castles made of smoke.The happy ending’s just the screeningprocess for who survives the joke.

We’re burying the notionthat good things come to those who wait,that patience is a magic potioninstead of just another name for fate

deciding you’re too passive to matter,too gentle to be taken seriously.We’re lowering into earth the patterof “everything happens for a reason”—mysteriously

hopeful garbage sold to keep you docile,to make you think your suffering has meaning,when really it’s just random, just hostilechaos disguised as destiny leaning

toward justice, toward balance, toward right.There is no cosmic accountant tallying scores.There’s just the day and then the nightand what you take before someone takes yours.

I’m saying Kaddish for Santa Claus,who taught me that rewards come freeif you just follow all the laws,if you’re good, if you believe, if you see

the world as moral meritocracyinstead of what it is: a cagewhere nice guys finish last, actually,and kindness doesn’t pay or age

like wine into wisdom.It just makes you a mark,a target for the systemthat eats the light and keeps the dark.

So here’s the funeral procession:every bedtime story that lied,every parable with a lessonthat doesn’t help you when you’ve tried

everything right and still lost,still bled, still broke, still fell.I’m burying hope that doesn’t count cost—that’s not hope, that’s a shell

designed to make you manageable,to keep you believing in tomorrowwhile they make today unbearable.I’m done outsourcing my sorrow

to fairy godmothers who never arrive.I’m my own rescue now.The only way I’m staying aliveis if I figure out how

without magic, without wishes,without happy accidents.I’m filling in the ditcheswhere fairy tales made residence.

And maybe this sounds bitter,maybe this sounds cold—but I’d rather be the quitterof beautiful lies than the sold

believer who keeps waitingfor a story to come true.This funeral is liberating:I bury them so I can bury you—

the version of me that needed fables,that couldn’t face the raw.Now I’m setting my own tables.Now I’m writing my own law.

Rest in peace, fairy tales.You did your damage, had your run.Now I’m beyond your veils—the funeral’s over.I’m the only one

who rises from this grave.

My First Philosopher Was Hunger

Before I read Descartes, I learned “I think, therefore I am”translated differently: I eat, therefore I survive.My first philosopher was hunger, persistent as a scam,teaching me that needs are the only truths that stay alive.

Hunger taught epistemology at 3 a.m.—how do we know what’s real? Your stomach answers first.Before metaphysics, before the abstract theorem,there’s the immediate, the physical, the thirst

that makes philosophy concrete, makes questions simple:not “what is the good?” but “where’s the next meal?”Not Plato’s forms or Kant’s categorical principle—just the raw data that tells you how to feel

your way through darkness toward something solid,something that’ll quiet the void inside.Hunger made me empiricist, made me squalidin my methods: test everything, verify, take what’s verified.

I learned logic from an empty fridge:if A (no food) and B (no money), then C (consequences).The syllogism of the street, the bridgebetween theory and practice, between pretences

and survival. Hunger taught me to strip awaythe unnecessary, to focus on what matters.Maslow before Hegel, every single day—lower needs before the higher ladders.

My philosopher spoke in stomach growls,in the clarity that comes from deprivation.No flowery language, no academic howls—just the pure, uncut sensation

of want transforming into will,of lack becoming motivation,of emptiness you have to fillor face your own negation.

Hunger taught me existentialism young:existence precedes essence, sure—but first, existence needs to be hungon something more than theory, more than pure

ideas floating in academic space.You are what you do to stay alive,not what you think while sitting safein places where you never had to strive

for basics, for the ground floor of being.Hunger gave me authenticity—there’s no pretending, no agreeingto conventions when you’re living in the city

of need, where philosophy meets pavement,where Nietzsche’s will to power is justthe will to eat, the will to save rent,the will to not become the dust

that everyone you know becomeswhen they stop fighting, stop believingnot in fairy tales but in the sumsthat add up to achieving

one more day, one more meal.Hunger made me pragmatist:truth is what works, what’s realis what keeps you on the list

of the living, of the fed,of those who wake tomorrow.Philosophy’s useless if you’re dead—hunger taught me that, and sorrow

taught me that comfortcreates the space for questionsthat don’t matter in the fortof those still learning lessons

from the original teacher,the first philosopher,the one whose reach youcan’t avoid or defer:

Hunger, pure and simple,teaching you that before you think,before your mind can ripplewith ideas, you need the link

between body and being,between matter and mind.My first philosopher was seeingclearly what theorists find

after decades of study:we are animals first,consciousness gets muddywhen it’s not immersed

in the fundamental truththat survival precedes thought,that comfort in your youthis the luxury that bought

you the privilege to wonderabout meaning, about why.My first philosopher was hunger.Everything else was a lie

told by the fullto the empty,by the comfortableto the needy.

Hunger taught me everythingbefore I read a single word.The rest was just the dressingon a truth I’d already heard.

The Art of the Necessary

Necessity has no morality—it has only teeth,and it will eat your personality,your ethics, your beliefs beneath

the weight of what must be done.This is the art I mastered:doing what can’t be undonein moments that moved too fast,

too urgent for philosophy,too immediate for debate.The art of the necessarydoesn’t negotiate, doesn’t wait

for you to feel comfortable,to make peace with the choice.It makes you accountablewithout giving you a voice

in the matter. You act,or you suffer the consequenceof inaction. That’s the pactyou sign with circumstance

when you’re born into the fire,when survival’s not a givenbut something you acquireby being unforgiven

in your methods, in your means.The art of the necessaryis painted in extreme scenesthat would make the ordinary

person flinch, would make them turn away.But I’m the artist here,and my canvas is today,and my palette’s made of fear,

hunger, desperation, need—colours that don’t blend pretty,but create the guaranteedoutcome: staying in the city

of the living, of the breathing.I perfected the techniqueof doing while they’re seething,while they critique

from positions of never having had to choosebetween two evils, two hells,two ways to loseeverything. The art excels

when executed without hesitation,without the luxury of timeto weigh each permutation,to check if you’re in line

with your values, with your code.The art of the necessaryrewrites that code, unloadsthe unnecessary

weight of should and ought and might.It deals in is and must,in the fightfor survival that adjusted

my moral compass to magnetic north—staying alive, protecting mine.The art brought fortha version of me designed

to do what needed doing,without the paralysisthat comes from viewingevery choice through the prism

of right and wrong, good and bad.The art sees only outcomes:did you get what you hadto get? Did you overcome

the obstacle, the threat, the challenge?Then the art succeeded.The historians can savageyour methods if they needed

villains for their narrative,but the art doesn’t careabout comparativemorality. It’s there

in the moment, in the splitsecond between action and consequence.The art’s legitimatein the dense

reality of survival,even if it looks uglyfrom outside. The arrivalat tomorrow is the only

metric that matters in the moment.Later, you can process,atone, fomentrevolution against the stress

that made you do what you did.But in the moment, the artis what kept you amidthe chaos, kept your heart

beating, your lungs breathing.I’m a master now—an artist in the wreathingof necessary actions around the brow

of survival like a crown,a technique passed downfrom every ancestor who foundthemselves in the profound

darkness where choice becomes simple:do or die, act or fall.The art’s not gentle,but it answers the call

when everything else—your morals, your beliefs, your fears—goes silent. It compelsyou through the years

of having to choosebetween bad and worse,between what you’ll loseand what you’ll rehearse

as justification later,when you have the luxuryof being an investigatorof your own history.

But in the moment, there’s no timefor investigation, for regret.In the moment, the crimeis hesitation. I met

every necessary momentwith action, decisiveness,the componentof survival that’s remiss

in those who’ve never had to practicethe art, who judge from safety,who think tacticsare chosen shapely,

carefully, with time to reflect.The art laughs at reflection.The art’s direct,immediate—a deflection

of death, of harm, of loss.I’m the artist of the necessary,and the costof my gallery

is measured in what I kept—my life, my family, my tomorrow—not in what I weptabout after. The sorrow

comes later, if at all.In the moment, there’s justthe art, the call,the necessary thrust

forward through whatever barrier,whatever line, whatever rulestood between me and the carrierof my future. I’m no fool—

I know what I’ve done,know what I’ve become.But I’m alive, and my soneats, and that sum

is the only mathematicsthat mattered when I executedthe art. The dramaticsof guilt can be rooted

out later, processed, understood.But first, I had to surviveby any means I could,by any means to arrive

at this moment where I caneven afford to contemplatethe moral spanbetween what’s right and what’s great—

timing, execution, effect.The art of the necessarydoesn’t genuflectto contemporary

moralists who never neededto practice it, never stoodat the crossroads where succeededmeans you did what you could—

not what you should.I mastered the art.I understoodthat the part

of me that’s goodhad to take a back seatwhen survival stoodin the street

demanding a decision.I made it.I’m here with precision,with the merit

of still breathing.That’s the art’s masterpiece:me, still being—me, at peace

with what had to be done.The art of the necessary—I didn’t just learn it. I wonfirst place in the contemporary

exhibition of survival.My work hangs in no museum,but my arrivalat today’s the premium

proof that the art works—that necessity’s brushstrokescan paint around the quirksof morality when stakes

demand it, when the canvasis your life and the painting’sdue now. The advantageof the art is its constraining

simplicity: do what must be done.Everything else is commentary.The art and I are one.The art of the necessary—

I am its living gallery.
